# SimplisticIO

**SimplisticIO** is a C++ library that provides a universal, abstract I/O interface, enabling seamless data access across diverse sources: memory, hardware, network, files, and inter-process communication. It abstracts complex I/O interactions into a single, flexible interface compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

### Key Features

-   **Unified I/O Abstraction**: Access various data sources through a single interface, simplifying code and enhancing portability.
-   **Flexible Memory Access**: Supports direct manipulation of memory entries, strings, and binary data.
-   **Modular and Extensible**: Easily adaptable to new I/O sources like device memory, network buffers, and mapped files.

### Potential

SimplisticIOâ€™s flexible interface allows effortless switching between data sources, enabling powerful applications in device drivers, networking, file mapping, and inter-process memory sharing.
